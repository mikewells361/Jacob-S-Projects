    <h1>Integrated Development Environment Info and Setup</h1>
    <h2>What is an Integrated Development Environment?</h2>
        <p>
            An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank">
            Integrated Development Environment</a> or "IDE" is software that makes it easier for you to develop software.
            It can autocomplete code for you, gives you an idea of the file structure, links in your build tools, and 
            gives you a graphical interface to see the changes you are making. They definitely make your job easier as a 
            developer, and I highly suggest you use one. You do not, however need to use an IDE to develop. IDEs just give
            you more tools and can save you a lot of headache in the long run.

        Acquiring an IDE is pretty easy. It's just like any other software, you can download it from the internet. There 
        are many IDEs out there, some free and some paid. Some of them are better for some languages than others. It just
        takes some experience with different IDEs to determine which one is a good fit for you.

        Personally, I really like an IDE called <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">VS Code</a>. It 
        has multiple language support, is supported by most operating systems, and is intuitive to use. I will provide some setup 
        instructions in the next section to get started with VS Code. However, there are lots of different IDEs. Finding the right
        one for you can take some trial and error and all of them have their pros/cons. A few
