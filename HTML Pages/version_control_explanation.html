    <h1>What is Version Control?</h1>
    <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank">Version control</a> is a way to manage file
    systems and code bases. It allows us to incrementally improve upon code without worrying about breaking code that already functions
    properly. New changes can be tested separate from the code base, and once the new changes are
    approved the new changes can be added to the code base.
    </p>

    If you take a look at the slightly confusing diagram, you will see the general way that version control works. In brief,
    version control works like this:
    <ol>
        <li>Each developer creates their own repository, or "copy" of the code, from the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code" target="_blank">source code</a>.</li>
        <li>The developer creates a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(revision_control)" target="_blank">branch</a>
             to work on new features, fix bugs, etc.</li>
        <li>When the developer has finished working on the feature, bug, etc., the developer has their code reviewed.</li>
        <li>Once code has been reviewed, the branch is merged into the source.</li>
        <li>Each developer updates their repository to include the new changes, and the cycle repeats.</li>
    </ol>   
    </p>
    <h1>But Why Should I Care About Version Control?</h1>
    <p>
        Excellent question. Think about it this way: what if coding was like designing a car? Each year a new car model comes out.
        They don't reinvent the car each time they want to improve on something, that would be expensive and time consuming. Instead
        they incrementally improve on each car. And what if there is a factory recall for a problem? They are able to fix the cars as
        the problems arise without worrying about affecting other systems. To take the analogy even further, oftentimes different models
        of car brands use the same parts. If they reinvented the car each time they released a new one, they would be unable to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like designing cars, coding uses the same principles for incrementally improving and adding new features. Version control allows
        us to use, reuse, and improve upon our already existing code base without having to reinvent it every time. If we worked on the 
        same project using the same files, eventually someone would do something that would break our carefully constructed system. Finding
        the issue would be much more difficult without a dedicated history of the changes we had made or without the ability to revert back
        to a previous version of the software. Version control allows us to to both of those things, and you will see the benefits of that
        as we work on this project.
    </p>
    <h1>You've got me sold. What do I do next?</h1>
    <p>
        There are lots of different version control systems. One I like to use is git. However, git is best used with a linux 
        system, and Windows operating systems are much more common. So what we are going to do is use a version control software
        called <a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, which has a desktop version of their software. The
        link will take you to the download page for the Windows desktop application. You will also need to create an account with 
        GitHub in order for us to collaborate. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've download and installed GitHub, the next thing to do is clone your repository. What this means is you are going to 
        create your own version of the code base that we are both working on. This is very easy to do in the GitHub app. So, go first 
        to the "File" menu and you should see an option to clone a repository. After selecting it, you should see the following:
    </p>
    <p>
        <picture>
            <source media="(min-width:200px)" srcset="../local files/clone-repo.jpg">
            <source media="(min-width:100px)" srcset="../local files/clone-repo.jpg">
            <img border="0" alt="clone a repository" src="../local files/clone-repo.jpg" style="max-width: 1200px;">
        </picture>
    </p>   
    <p>
        From there, you can set the path on your computer where you want to work from. From there, you will be able to view the source code,
        make branches to work from, and create pull requests so I can review your code and add your changes. I will show you the nuances behind
        all that, but with this basic setup, you will be able to get started!
    </p>
