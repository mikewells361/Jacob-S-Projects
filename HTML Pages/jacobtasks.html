            <h1>Tasks to work on:</h1>
            <p>
                Here I've decided to list a few things that we can do to help you get familiar with coding, webpages, and html in general.
                <ul>
                    <li>Visit <a href="version_control_explanation.html" target="_blank">the version control page</a> and get setup 
                         with access to the code base. Create a branch and work on any of the listed activities.</li>
                    <li>This webpage looks terrible. I did nothing to format it or make it appealing in any way.
                        It would be nice if you could add some flavor to it. Get a background. Good font. That sort of thing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use a simple script in JavaScript to make this webpage more interactive. Here's an example:
                        <button type="button"
                        onclick="document.getElementById('datetime').innerHTML = Date()">
                        Click me to display Date and Time.</button>
                    </li>
                    <li>Create your own html page and add a link on the mainpage.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p id="datetime"></p>
            <h1>Okay, I finished a task, now what?</h1>
            <p>
                Create a pull request and I will look over it. Then I can merge your changes and update the webpage!
            </p>
