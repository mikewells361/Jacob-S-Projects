        Well, the reason is because I had an epiphany the other day. I realized that it may be easier for you to learn to code if you 
        have a dedicated space to practice. So I decided to help out a little bit. I created this webpage as a working site for you to
        be able to practice all the things you are learning in your coding practice. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I've always personally had a hard time with some of the tutorials for coding you can find online. Usually because they have no
        real application with what they are teaching you. The idea is that you learn a bunch of coding principles with simple examples,
        and then if you want to learn more about the specific coding application you come up with your own idea and then use it. That
        is all well and good, but what if you don't have a good idea of what you want to do with your newfound knowledge? All of a sudden
        all your effort becomes wasted, because you weren't able to apply your new skill to something to see the result.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's where this site comes in. Here you can come up with ideas of how to implement new skills you learn yourself as you keep
        studying. I've come up with a few things to help you, such as a version control method so we don't worry about breaking anything.
        Here below I've listed a few steps.
    </p>
    <h2>First, a quick word about the website setup.</h2>
    <p>
        As you may have noticed, this site doesn't have much going for it. It is laughably basic. This is by design at this point. How 
        this site ends up is up to you. It is your sandbox to play with, mold, and improve on. I probably won't do a whole lot of work
        past the initial setup and the builds. The reason for this is that I want you to be able to use this to keep your projects for
        the future. A point of reference. A portfolio. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The advantage of this is that you now have somewhere to grow. Every change you make now has a purpose. Every lesson you learn 
        will be etched on the web for you to see. Not only that, you will be able to see your progress. So grow. Catch the coding fever.
        I can tell you I had a lot of fun putting even this super basic site together. Imagine how cool it will be for you to show something
        like this to a future employer someday. 
    </p>
    <h2>Okay. Let's get set up.</h2>
    <p>
        You may have noticed a few links on the main page called <a href="ide_setup.html" target="_blank">IDE Setup</a> and 
        <a href="version_control_explanation.html" target="_blank">Version Control Information</a>. I suggest you start there. Those will
        explain two things to you that will help with making the coding environment a little more comfortable to you. Below is a quick 
        explanation of both of those for you, just in brief.
    </p>
    <h3>What is an IDE?</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/09/cover-template--4-.png" 
        jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" jsname="HiaYvf" class="n3VNCb pT0Scc KAlRDb" role="" 
        aria-label="" alt="What is an IDE? IDE Meaning in Coding" data-noaft="1" 
        style="width: 465px; height: 261.562px; margin: 0px;">
    </p>
    <p>
        An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank">IDE</a> or "Integrated Development
        Environment" is software that gives you the tools to code. They will do things like autocomplete commands, check for errors in 
        syntax, and provide a way to easily run your code. I've used a few IDEs in my time, and they always make things easier, even if 
        you don't need them to develop. Check out the <a href="ide_setup.html" target="_blank">IDE Setup</a> page to get started.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Version Control?</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="https://learn-cf.ni.com/products/intro_scc_and_vcs.png" jsaction="load:XAeZkd;" jsname="HiaYvf" 
        class="n3VNCb pT0Scc KAlRDb" role="" aria-label="" 
        alt="Intro to Source Code Control and Distributed Version Control Systems -  National Instruments" 
        data-noaft="1" style="width: 465px; height: 294.67px; margin: 0px;">
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank">Version control</a> will allow us to manage the code base
        without worrying about breaking the code. It allows us to incrementally improve on our site and functions and handle errors without
        taking the whole site down. Go ahead and visit <a href="version_control_explanation.html" target="_blank">Version Control Information</a>
        to get started with version control.
    </p>
    <h2>Just one last thing, and then I'll cut you loose.</h2>
    <p>
        What you get out of this is entirely up to you. I suggest setting a goal for yourself for how much you want to work on
        this. Start with an hour or so a week. Just enough to keep honest. You'll eventually get the hang of coding and see how you can flex
        your coding muscles. You can go at your own pace and learn as you can. Don't get discouraged, even if you think this is a lot. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Like I said before, my main idea behind this was to provide a way for you to get more familiar with coding, gain computer literacy,
        and prepare for future educational opportunities. Don't worry about removing or replacing the basic pages I have put up for you, they
        really are just guides to get you started. If you want to remove these pages and start again, feel free. Take this any direction
        you like. I'm really excited to see what you come up with!

        I'm really excited to be part of this with you. You're going to crush it. So get out there man, let's get this thing off the ground!
